# Problem Definition
You are a newly hired business analyst at Andreesen Horowitz, the famously techno-optimist private Venture Capital firm in Silicon Valley. You are tasked with preparing a presentation on Apple's successful organizational model per the provided report from the Harvard Business Review - "How Apple is Organized for Innovation". You plan to take help from a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enabled Large Language Model, to help extract information in a targeted manner from the article efficiently. This will enable you to go through the dense content of the report to get exactly the information you require on how Apple structures its teams and processes for optimal creativity and innovation.

***Note*** : If you see any kind of warnings while installing the libraries, you can simply ignore them, as they won't affect the execution flow of the file.

# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- An important application of LLMs is enabling users to query unstructured data in natural language. This is finding a lot of traction in industries where the data is naturally unstructured in nature (e.g., finance, healthcare).

The figure below shows how the finance sector is utilizing LLMs to query and summarize documents.

Document-based Q&A is achieved using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG is a technique that combines the capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) with external data sources to generate more accurate and informative text. The key ideas are:

Bridging the gap between generative models and external knowledge: RAG integrates LLMs, which excel at generating fluent text, with retrieval models that can access and incorporate relevant information from external knowledge bases or databases.

Improving contextual understanding and content generation: By accessing external information, RAG models can generate text that is not only fluent but also grounded in real-world knowledge, leading to more accurate and contextually relevant responses. This is particularly useful for tasks like question-answering, summarization, and dialogue systems.

Reducing bias and misinformation: RAG can help verify generated content against external sources, incorporating diverse perspectives and producing more balanced and factually accurate outputs. This helps address issues of bias and misinformation that can arise in standalone LLMs.

Flexibility and scalability: RAG architectures are designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing them to leverage domain-specific knowledge bases and scale effectively to handle large-scale information sources.

Continuous learning and improvement: RAG systems can be designed to continuously learn and improve over time by incorporating feedback mechanisms and iterative refinement processes. This contributes to the long-term effectiveness and reliability of RAG-powered applications.

In summary, RAG combines the strengths of generative language models and retrieval models to produce text that is more accurate, contextually relevant, and grounded in external knowledge, addressing key limitations of standalone LLMs.



A Workflow for RAG
The figure below depicts the key stages involved in designing a RAG solution using LLMs. Let us look at each stage in detail.
